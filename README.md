Image Classification Tutorial with the MedNIST Dataset
Introduction In this tutorial, we introduce an end-to-end training and evaluation example based on the MedNIST dataset. We'll go through the following steps:

Create a MONAI Dataset for training and testing
- Use MONAI transforms to pre-process data
- Use the DenseNet from MONAI for the classification task
- Train the model with a PyTorch program
- Evaluate on test dataset

Get the dataset
The MedNIST dataset was gathered from several sets from TCIA, the RSNA Bone Age Challenge, and the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
